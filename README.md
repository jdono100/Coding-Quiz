# Week 04 Coding Quiz

In this week (and a few days) I made a challenging coding quiz that keeps track of scores and stores them in local storage.

I thought that the easiest way for me to navigate and seperate my program's functionality was to make multiple HTML and JavaScript files and link them seperately.

I spent the first few days setting up the HTML and CSS to what I felt was pleasing to look at and then got to cracking on the JavaScript.
There was a lot of resistance as I don't think that JavaScript is my strongest language (yet!), but eventually I figured out a way to randomize the questions while 
not having them repeat using .splice() & Math.random().

There was some struggling in regards to local storage at first as well as properly formatting the popup high scores window on the homepage, but after much googling and messing about I finally got them both to work.

I need to start git committing more often and am sorry I haven't been, life sort of got in the way this week and I apologize for the delay.

I plan on adding a button to view a popup of the highscores to the inputhighscores.html page as well as cleaner button stylings.
